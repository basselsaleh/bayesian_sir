# Bayesian SIR Model for Infectious Disease Spread

This is just a small personal project, the purpose of which is to demonstrate the power of Bayesian inversion by looking at a potent example, a simple SIR model for infectious disease spread. I'm testing my own code for modeling and sampling, as well as generally flexing the powerful muscles of `jax`, utilizing the GPU on my desktop workstation to perform highly parallelized sampling.

**At the moment this does not work and is still a work in progress. I plan to return to it when I have time.**
